* Description

This program implements a full simulation of a pedestrian crossing
system on the =PIC 16F84A= Millennium development board and is written
in =C/embedded C=.

It produces this simulation on the board using the inbuilt lights, buzzer and
buttons. It implements the standard light sequence used by
British traffic lights, and listens for a button interrupt to
appropriately trigger the "crossing" sequence, whereupon the appropriate
light sequence and a buzzer are triggered to simulate the audible
warning heard on real-world British pedestrian crossings.

The project makes use of a full *test case scenarios*, structured *program
design* with *modelled data flows and state transitions*, together with
subsequent iterations of the source code (originally outside =git=).

Fully illustrated complete *documentation* (overview; design; testing;
codebase) is provided in the project *[[PIC-traffic-light.pdf][PDF]]* file, and the complete source
code is provided in the [[./src][src]] directory. Some sample images from the
documentation are show below; view the PDF for the full elaboration.

* About

This project came about whilst playing/experimenting with a borrowed PIC
microcontroller. I wanted to increase my understanding of embedded systems
by coding a small project, as previously most of my software development
experience had been with higher level languages such as Java..
