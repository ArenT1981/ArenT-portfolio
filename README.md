# Portfolio

Portfolio of my projects and work.

- [Agent Maze Searcher](./agent-maze-searcher)

A program written in Scheme/Racket that reads in a maze/2D world input from a file, and then presents a valid solution path to the destination/treasure (if it exists).

- [PIC Microcontroller Traffic Light Simulator](./PIC-traffic-light)

Simulates a rudimentary traffic light simulation on the Millennium board using the LEDs and button. Written in embedded C.
