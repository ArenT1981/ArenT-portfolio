Traffic Light System for PIC Microcontroller

## DESCRIPTION:

A traffic light simulator written in embedded C for the PIC 16F84A Microcontroller and Millennium board.  

It produces an appropriate simulation on the board using its inbuilt lights and buttons. It implements the standard light sequence used by British traffic lights, and listens for a button interrupt to appropriately trigger the "crossing" sequence, with the appropriate light sequence and a buzzer to simulate the audible warning heard on British pedestrian crossings.  

The project makes use of a full test case scenario, structured program design with modelled data flows and state transitions, together with subsequent iterations of the source code.

Complete documentation (overview; design; testing; codebase) is provided in [PIC-traffic-light.pdf](./PIC-traffic-light.pdf) and the source code is in the [src](./src/) directory.
