* Description 

Maze searching program implemented in =Scheme/Racket=.

[[./agent-maze-searcher-0.2.gif]]

Screencast above demonstrates the program running and the structure of
its data files.

Originally written in Scheme and then ported to Racket (only minor
adjustments needed), this program implements a maze/path searching
algorithm that simulates a robot reaching a destination goal.

It reads input from a data file which defines the following properties:

- The size of the maze/2D world
- The quantity of obstacles/obstructions (i.e. walls)
- The grid of obstacles/navigable space

After parsing the file, it displays it an ASCII visual depiction of the
maze/world. It then implements a recursive breadth-first search
algorithm to locate the path from the robot's starting destination to
the goal, if one exists. This path is then shown as a list of tuples
specifying the path. The maze data structure is stored internally as a
matrix.

Source code is in the [src](./src/) directory. Documentation pending.

See the [CHANGELOG](./src/CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.
