* Description

This program implements a basic multi-threaded web server written in
=Java=. 

It makes uses of =Thread= and =ServerSocket= from the Java API to
output a chunked transfer stream to negotiate the basic HTTP protocol
and serve up static webpages.

The project makes use of *iterative development*, structured *object
orientated program design*, and a specifically developed test-client to
test whether it handles spawning off threads correctly.

Fully illustrated complete *documentation* (overview; design; testing;
codebase) is provided in the project *[[https://github.com/ArenT1981/ArenT-portfolio/raw/master/code/java-mt-webserver/Java-mt-server.pdf][PDF]]* file, and the complete source
code is provided in the [[./src][src]] directory (together with the example basic
test page/site). Some sample images from the documentation are shown
below; view the PDF for the full elaboration.
