* Description

A =bash= convenience wrapper/customisation script for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] that automates
multiple profile switching using [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs][chemacs]] together with a configuration
backup, orientated towards [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] users. The primary purpose behind
this  was to ease having both a "stable" (known good) and
"development/daily" setup, so that if you should accidentally break your
Emacs setup, you would still have a known good setup you could
immediately use if you have urgent work pending.

* Usage

By default all your emacs configurations will be stored under
=~/.emacs-configs=. If you want them stored elsewhere, edit the
parameters =EMACS_CONFIG_BASE_DIR=, =SPACEMACS_STABLE=, and
=SPACEMACS_DAILY=, where =EMACS_CONFIGS_BASE_DIR= is the root directory,
and =SPACEMACS_DAILY= is your latest =emacs= configuration, with
=SPACEMACS_STABLE= as your (read-only) backup =emacs=.
