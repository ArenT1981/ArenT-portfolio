* Description

The objective of this script is to fully automate converting Garmin
=FIT= files to standard interchangeable =CSV= format (compressed with
gzip to save space) by making use of Max Candocia's Python [[https://github.com/mcandocia/fit_processing][script]], and
then generating attractive graphs from the data via [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][Gnuplot]] and finally
attach and insert them into a pre-formatted
[[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file. 

In short, to create a fully automated *plain text workout diary* as an offline and
easily processed workout log. The longer term plan is to build this into
a full Emacs package on [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]], whereupon it will act as a full workout
diary package, enabling summary statistics and easily automated logging,
all directly called from within Emacs with a single command.

It is a complementary package to my [[../secretary][secretary]] =bash= program, which is
designed to easily create automated file transfer patterns based on file
date/metadata/globbing patterns, and specific target directories; in
short, with one singe command to automatically copy all the files off
your Garmin watch/device, neatly organised into an appropriate directory
structure.

The directory also includes a small helper script used to add the
appropriate timestamp information to =FIT= files which have been
imported by [[https://www.goldencheetah.org/][Golden Cheetah]] for users who have imported all their
workouts via that software (it can download them via [[https://www.trainingpeaks.com/][Training Peaks]] and
other such cloud sites are synced with the Garmin Connect API). The
files that Golden Cheetah import have their timestamps in the filename
but the actual file timestamp is, of course, their creation time, which
is not so helpful in terms of storing them in a neat directory structure
automatically based on the file timestamp metadata.

At the moment the script is not quite production ready, but it can
successfully convert and recognise most major workout types (Rowing,
Strength Training, Cycling, etc.) and appropriately store them in a
date-ordered directory complete with neatly generated =png= files and
the resultant compressed =csv= files containing all the source data.
Currently it makes use of a slightly customised version of the
aforementioned =FIT= to =CSV= conversion script based on my own hacking,
but I plan to update it with a version that will work with the script
"out of the box". 

* =TODO= 

- Make some tidying adjustments to the GNU Plot templates for better
  column selection using the original =csv= generated from Candocia's
  script  
- Improve the aesthetics of the graphs. At the moment the duration is
  represented by a time-of-day axis (inspect the graphs to see what I
  mean!), but a duration calculated from the start-time of the actual HR
  data would be far better, and could appear along the other x-axis at
  the top of the graph (currently not used, just where the title is) 
- Write the boilerplate for automatically generating the appropriate
  org-mode text 
- Write an Emacs-lisp script to integrate it fully into Emacs. The end
  goal is that only /one/ command need be called within Emacs to
  automatically scan, import, convert, generate all graphs, generate all
  the workout org-files, and add them as nodes in your main
  =exercise.org= date-time tree, for all such files as since your last
  invocation. All that would remain is for you to write your summary
  comments/notes, add any details of specific weight-training (sadly the
  weight-reps information is not extractable from the FIT file; it must
  be stored in a proprietary binary block within the =FIT= file) and you
  have a fully offline exercise log.

I will add an example fully completed =org-mode= file on here when I get
a chance, to illustrate what the finished result will look like.

Below are a some example graphs generated automatically by the
script given an input =FIT= file:
