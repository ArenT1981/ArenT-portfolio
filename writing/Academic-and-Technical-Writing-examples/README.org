* Academic and Technical Writing

[[../../assets/img/academic-header.png]] 

One of the key qualities of being a successful software or system
engineer is the ability to communicate complex information effectively
and clearly. This can take several forms: documentation, whether
that be official or for internal only use; presentations, both of a
technical and business orientated nature; and written technical
documents, white-papers, and research papers. 

This directory contains a representative selection of my recent academic
work, that showcases my ability to produce high quality material that
comprises detailed and precise English together with high quality
diagrams, smart presentation, and coherent logical ordering.

Full title: 

"Attack of the Algorithm: The Demand for a new Hermeneutics Towards Autonomous Systems"

This is an accessible philosophical paper on the ethical implications of
algorithms as deployed by autonomous/machine learning systems and their
increasing prevalence in day-to-day life.

Abstract:

#+BEGIN_SRC text 
This paper presents a brief survey of some of the contemporary ethical issues surrounding
the ever more pervasive presence of autonomous systems and the algorithms running
them, using self-driving vehicles and autonomous weapon systems as key studies. The issue
of codifying ‘morality’ is considered, concluding with a phenomenological aside on the
affect of such technology drawing on Heidegger.

** Nutrition & Physiology

*** [[https://github.com/ArenT1981/ArenT-portfolio/raw/master/writing/Academic-and-Technical-Writing-examples/nutritional-and-physiological-principles.pdf][Essential Nutritional and Physiological Principles]]

This is a compact and concise handbook/mini-book I wrote as an "all-in-one" guide
to correct nutrition and dietary practices to support my clients to
achieve their goals whilst I worked as a Personal Trainer.

It covers all of the essential fundamentals of nutrition for human
wellness and sports performance, together with intake guidelines,
suggested menu's that put the principles into practice, and other
ancillary information related making correct and informed decisions
regarding dietary and nutritional choices.

** Teaching & Language Development

*** [[https://github.com/ArenT1981/ArenT-portfolio/raw/master/writing/Academic-and-Technical-Writing-examples/Learning-skills-reflective-journal.pdf][Learning Skills: A Reflective Journal]]

In the modern age we all need to learn at an unprecedented rate in order
to even simply keep up with current trends within any one particular
sector or industry. Yet the actual meta-cognitive skills and
requirements of /learning/ itself often receive scant attention: we do
not teach people /how/ to learn. Yet it precisely the set of practices
and skills that a person adopts in approaching learning that directly
relate to how well they actually accomplish that learning. 

In short, we need to /learn/ how to /learn/ first; this is a skill that
should be revisited periodically, as it is something that can be
improved with explicit attention, just like any other learnable skill.

This is an accompanying very short visual presentation that illustrates
the huge value that effective mind-mapping brings to the learning
process. Do you mind-map? If not, you probably should!

*** [[https://github.com/ArenT1981/ArenT-portfolio/raw/master/writing/Academic-and-Technical-Writing-examples/Second-Language-Testing.pdf][Second Language Testing]]

How do we know whether our teaching is effective, unless we have some
metric by which to measure progress? If we are not testing, we are
guessing! 

Yet successful testing, whether it is for second language acquisition or
any other skill, is not so straightforward. 

This document explores some of the statistical analysis mechanisms by
which we can ascertain whether our testing strategy is effective and
well-balanced. 

Tests need to be extremely well designed to actually test what they
purport to test. This may seem obvious, but the fact remains that many
tests do /not/ in fact actually test the skill we are primarily interested in
testing, but rather test something /different/, yet which we erroneously
believe to be testing our intended skill. 

This applies equally to software engineering: Just because the software
works fine with your small dataset or expected set of test inputs, does
not guarantee that the performance will be as expected in a real-world
production environment! Tests must accurately represent the actual
environment upon which the production system is to be deployed.

A vital skill is the ability to reflect both on other's work and your
own in a critical and dispassionate manner, to evaluate its strengths
and weaknesses, respective merits, degree of accuracy, and level of
insight. Even the simple act of /reading/ is actually a /process/, not a
simple event. 

This piece of work examines the nature of reading, together with
critical reflections on group observations and others work.

Writing itself is also an iterative strategy. Software is the art of
both writing code and documentation; both are critical. Without one, you
have no product; without the other you have no maintainability, and you
place a heavy and unnecessary conceptual burden on your users to have to
interpret and abstract how it functions or is used. 

Good communicative documentation should always make use of diagrams,
which is precisely what this document does.

We are all teachers, and we are all learners. The only way we can cope
with the conceptual complexity of the world we inhabit is to pool and
distribute our knowledge; we can become domain experts or develop
proficiencies in one area, and then /communicate/ those insights concisely
to another, condensing what is vital or critical. And in fact, this is
how businesses operate, and how successful teams work together. The
difficulty of the task is distributed across the team members, and by
each member addressing their particular role and feeding that
information back into the collective knowledge pool, so expertise at
tacking extremely complex problems gets delivered. The solving of such
problems is where businesses generate their commercial value. 

The business identifies a problem to be solved; they solve it; they
market the solution to others for whom that solution is extremely
valuable to their operational goals.

** Business & Analytics

** [[https://github.com/ArenT1981/ArenT-portfolio/raw/master/writing/Academic-and-Technical-Writing-examples/Ignite-system.pdf][A technical analysis of the Ignite retail system]]

This is an extended white-paper that conducts a detailed analysis of the
real-world impact of deploying a digital stock control system. There is
a common assumption, a serious misconception, that merely deploying a
new technology will automatically lead to increased productivity gains
in a company.

This is fatally flawed viewpoint. Technology only leads to productivity
gains when it is fully integrated into the work practices and workflow
the business that is deploying it, with particular attention paid to the
highly particular real-world constraints under which it operates. These
constraints can be, and often are, quite different to the constraints
under which a system might be idealised to operate in, or in the
abstract notions under which it is designed. 

In short, it is only when the system is put into the real world can we
evaluate its performance. The conditions under which the technology is
used are also as vital as the technology itself; insufficient staffing,
inadequate expertise, or failure to address the environment upon which
it operates are all critical factors. A warehouse robot is only useful
if the floor it operates upon is sufficiently smooth and well-finished
for it to be able to trundle around without impediment for example; yet
it is precisely small details like these that can get overlooked by
businesses.

This document was a critical assessment of how a failure to adequately
design a system, both in terms of its functionality and operating
logistics, and a failure in terms of fully addressing the environment
and factors surrounding its use actual led to an observable /decline/ in
productivity, not gain, as a result of this new technology.
